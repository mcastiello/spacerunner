# Space Runner
This is a simple shoot-em-up game that I created for a technical test for **Play'n'Go**.

The game is made using [PIXI](https://www.pixijs.com/) and you can play a live demo [here](http://s18605048.onlinehome-server.info/data/projects/spacerunner/).

## Controls
All the game buttons start the exact the same game. I'm not crazy, it was a test requirement, anyway, once you click on **Game N** you are ready to go.

Control the ship with the arrows (*left*, *right*, *top* and *down*) and you can shoot the enemies pressing the *space bar*.

There's no point and no glory, after all it's just a test that I developed in a sunday afternoon :-)

When you get hit by an alien spaceship or one of their torpedo you're dead and the galaxy is doomed.

**Special Tanks** to my lovely wife [Elisa Moriconi](http://elisamoriconi.com) who made the assets for the game.
